[How this React App gets Movie data from a RESTful API](https://rbaek.dev/projects/movie-app/)

This post will assume you know about JSX, basic React app architecture and javascript.

In this post I will be going over props and state in React. 

In the next post, I will go over how to get data from a RESTful API using promises to complete a functioning React movies app. 

Then we will change those promises to use async/await and discuss the benefits of doing so. After that we will explore React Redux for state management and how React Hooks come into play as well.

<i>Before all that though, let's get acquainted with React props and state.</i>

A prop is a property of a React component that can be passed down to other React components from a parent. 
Let's say we have a `Bookstore` component, which has a child, the `BestSellersTable`

- Note: A React component is basically just a function that can have a props parameter which takes in the argument specified when the function/component is called.

```jsx
//gets props from it's parent: Bookstore
const BestSellersTable = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
        <h3>The Top 3 Best Sellers</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>{props.first.title}</li>
        <li>{props.second.title}</li>
        <li>{props.third.title}</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    );}
```
The parent component Bookstore passes down the properties of the first, second, and third objects inside the books object.
`first = {books.first}` etc.., `first` here will become `props.first` in the BestSellersTable function/component. 
```jsx
const Bookstore = () => {
    const books = {
        first: {
            title: 'Really Awesome Book',
            copiesSold: 9999
        },
        second: {
            title: 'Awesome Book',
            copiesSold: 8888
        },
        third: {
            title: 'Great Book',
            copiesSold: 7777
        }
    }
return (
    <div>
        <h1> Welcome to the Bookstore </h1>
        <h2> Best Sellers Table! </h2>
            //calling child function and passing these arguments that become the passed props object
            <BestSellersTable 
            first={books.first} 
            second={books.second} 
            third={books.third} 
            />
    </div>
);}

```
Here is a CodeSandbox of the code in action. I also used template literals with ` backticks to add a comma, space, and the copiesSold property into the output. ( I didn't put it in the example code above to try to keep it simple looking )
- Note: Things like arrow functions, template strings, and destructuring are ES6 and are transpiled by Babel(etc) into code that older browsers can understand too.

In React, you will have components that have a state, or don't have state.

State is an object of a component that holds values and those values can change. 
It is considered good practice, not to directly change (mutate) the object and its values directly. 
Then you can have a history of the data changes and a predictable state. 
This is called immutability in which you are making and mutating copies 
of the previous state and leaving the previous state(s) as immutable objects. ( costing some extra memory )

Let's go over two common ways that state would be declared in a React component.

- Note: React component names should start with a capital letter

```jsx
class MyReactComponent extends React.Component {
state = {
    matterState: 'liquid',
    particlesPerSqNano: (this.props.someValue * 2000)
    }
render() { 
return ( // some stuff 
);}
```
or 

```jsx
class MyReactComponent extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
    matterState: 'gas',
    particlesPerSqNano: (props.someValue * 2000)
    }
}
render() { 
return ( // some stuff 
);}
```
Woah, so what's all this `props`, `this.props`, `this.state`, no this. `state` stuff going on here.

Well, these two are just two ways of writing the same thing, dont' get confused now!

Both ways are talking about `this.` component's state and the props that were passed down to `this.` component.

Now, you may be looking at this example and thinking it is similar to the Bookstore example.
Bingo! it is similar, but there are reasons to use `state` as the object. I will go over
this in part II!
