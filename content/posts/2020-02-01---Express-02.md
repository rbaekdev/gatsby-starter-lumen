Let's go over Express.js middleware

### Express Middleware Functions

They have access to the request object (req), response object (res), and the next function (next)
The `next()` function executes the next middleware in the line to be executed

Middleware functions can:
- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request and response objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware in the stack

Note: using `return next();` instead of just `next()`  ensure the function will stop executing and move on to the next middleware.

To load a middleware function, call `app.use('middleware')`
The order is important: loaded first = executed first

Won't load if it is called after the request-response cycle is terminated.

```javacsript
var myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('LOGGED')
  next()
}

app.use(myLogger)

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})
```
For example, myLogger will run and console log 'LOGGED' here,
but if it was loaded after the route get request it would not run
because the route handler of the root path terminates the req-res cycle.

has references to Express middleware
and properties/methods of app, req, res, and router

If you need middleware that can have options, export a function like:
```javascript
module.exports = function (options) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    // Implement the middleware function based on the options object
    next()
  }
}
```
